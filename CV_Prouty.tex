% I would pull out the comet research/observing experience from telescope director and make it its own thing "Astronomical Observations & Research" cuz STScI will care more about that than open house
%
% Under programming, list python first "Extensive use of python"   (grammar: "have delivered" not "has" this is YOUR cv -- add IRAF (experience with IRAF) - you need to catch their attention and you can RTFM
%
% experience with interfacing instrumentation with Raspberry Pi )ok, it hasn't happened yet, but it will)
%
% List your papers, including the one that is in preparation

%
% Add your robotics teaching experience w/ AACPS
%
% can talk in the evening after the hideous class is over, and gotta go to colloquium...its an Earth science one so I should go
%
% falling out now
