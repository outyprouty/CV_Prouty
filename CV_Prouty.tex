						   % I would pull out the comet research/observing experience from telescope director and make it its own thing "Astronomical Observations & Research" cuz STScI will care more about that than open house
						   % 
						   % Under programming, list python first "Extensive use of python"   (grammar: "have delivered" not "has" this is YOUR cv -- add IRAF (experience with IRAF) - you need to catch their attention and you can RTFM
						   % 
						   % experience with interfacing instrumentation with Raspberry Pi )ok, it hasn't happened yet, but it will)
						   % 
						   % List your papers, including the one that is in preparation

						   % 
						   % Add your robotics teaching experience w/ AACPS
						   % 
						   % can talk in the evening after the hideous class is over, and gotta go to colloquium...its an Earth science one so I should go
						   % 
						   % falling out now
